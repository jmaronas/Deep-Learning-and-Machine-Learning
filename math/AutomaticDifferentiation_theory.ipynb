    "\\frac{\\partial y}{\\partial x} = 3 \\cdot (x^2 - 4)^2 \\cdot 2 x\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "something we usually derive implicitely using our knowledge of basic derivatives, such that the derivative of $f(x)^{n}$ is $f(x)^{n-1} \\cdot f'(x)$. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, when things get complicate we need to specify a way to obtain complex derivatives, and this is where the chain rule comes into place. For functions $f:\\mathbb{R} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$, we can use the one-dimensional chain rule. \n",
    "\n",
    "The idea of the chain rule is to express functions as composition of elementary functions from which the derivative is well known. In our example we could break into a small composition of functions.\n",

    "z = u^3 \\\\\n",
    "y = z + 2 \n",

    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start substituting to show it is equivalent. First subsitute $z = u^3$ into $y = z + 2$, yielding $y = u^3 + 2$. Now do the same thing and substitute $u = t - 4$ into $y = u^3 + 2$, yielding: $y = (t - 4)^3 + 2$, and finally subsitute $t = x^2$ into $y = (t - 4)^3 + 2$ yielding $y = ( x^2 - 4)^3 + 2$, which is our original function.\n",

In fact, the most important thing is that this gives a principle way of obtaining complex derivatives in a structured and well-ordered way. In fact, in this example when you applied the rule $f(x)^{n}$ is $f(x)^{n-1} \\cdot f'(x)$, to obtain $\\frac{\\partial y}{\\partial x}$ directly, you are implicitely applying the chain rule without noticing it.\n",

    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the last is step is to actually have a derivative which is a function of $x$. In other words, we need to replace the value of $u$ in this example. So using a similar proceedure as above we know the steps to perform are: \n",
